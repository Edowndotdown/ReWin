ReWin

----------=========== Introduction ==========------------
Windows Reloaded refines Windows with a better UI, minimal telemetry, a new package manager, and much more, all while lowering the requirements of Windows 11 to run.
----------=========== Contents ==========------------
Open Shell
	-Open shell brings many new features to Windows. The default changes are;
		-New Start menu. As many people miss the Windows 7 style start menu, and search, OpenShell is able to bring the look and feel of Windows 7 Start menu, with a modern twist.
		-New Taskbar. Slight modifications to the Windows taskbar allowing a more modern look to the taskbar.
		-A new Start Button. To further differentiate Windows from ReWin, a new logo has been applied to the start button, giving it a more HomeBrew feel

Windows Aero
	-Windows Aero brings a new look to classic windows programs. Although highly changeable, to keep with the Windows theme, changes were kept minimal. These changes include;
		-Pre UWP settings app Control Panel tabs. With UWP Settings, many users felt confused on why some settings were in Control Panel, and others in UWP Settings. This update allows the use of just Control Panel, allowing minimal searching for settings.
		-Desktop gadgets. Due to the overwhelming amount of people who wish Desktop Gadgets were still around, this seemed like something we should add.

O&O Shutup Windows
	-O&O Shutup removes many, but not all telemetry data. Due to the high amount of changes, it will not be listed here. (Not because I'm lazy and still need to code the package manager, and the installer.)

Windows Tweaker
	-Windows Tweaker allows more customization to windows, as well as double check no settings were missed from O&O Shutup.

Windows Package Manager
	-Windows Package Manager allows the compaction and disabling of default Windows apps such as Microsoft App store, Microsoft edge, Phone, and more.

----------=========== Notes ==========------------
Due to this being a quick side project, any future updates are not guaranteed. If enough support is shown, I will continue with this project. Feel free changing the code, making a spin-off or anything else.
As of now, the project should be completed at the end or March 2023. Feedback is greatly appreciated.
